**Abstract:**
This project introduces a Pursuit Evasion game implemented through a graph data structure. The Driver class is responsible for running the game, and two key player algorithms, namely “MoveAwayPlayerAlgorithm” and “MoveTowardsPlayerAlgorithm”, enhance gameplay by providing strategic movement for the evader and pursuer, respectively.

**Results:**
The Driver class generates a random graph, instigates pursuit between a pursuer and an evader, and strategically moves the players. The “MoveTowardsPlayerAlgorithm” class intelligently guides the pursuer to move towards the evader during the game while the “MoveAwayPlayerAlgorithm” moves the evader away from the pursuer. When both the evader and the pursuer land on the same vertex, the pursuer wins.

**Strengths of this project:** 
1. Flexibility and Customization:
The project allows users to customize graph density and the number of vertices through user input. This flexibility ensures adaptability to varying scenarios, making the project versatile and applicable in different contexts.

2. Interactive Visualization:
The inclusion of a graphical representation of the game using the “GraphDisplay” class enhances user interaction and understanding. Visualizing the pursuit and evasion dynamics adds clarity to the gameplay and aids in debugging.

3. Modular Design:
The use of classes and methods with well-defined responsibilities contributes to a modular and maintainable codebase. This design facilitates future modifications, extensions, and integration of additional features.

**Significance of this Project:**
 1. Real-world Relevance:
Pursuit Evasion scenarios are prevalent in real-world applications, such as robotics, surveillance, and security. This project serves as a foundation for understanding and simulating such scenarios, providing insights into strategic decision-making and pursuit dynamics.

2. Educational Value:
The project serves as an excellent educational resource for understanding and implementing graph data structures. It provides a practical application of theoretical concepts, and make it valuable for students and developers looking to enhance their knowledge.
